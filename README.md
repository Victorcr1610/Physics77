# Physics77

Hello dear reader, this is my physics 77: Introduction to Computational Techniques in Physics, where I learned to do visualization, statistics and probability, regression, numerical integration, simulation, data modeling, function approximation, and algebraic systems. The code is all on Jupyter Notebooks so feel free to download and look at my final project and other material.
